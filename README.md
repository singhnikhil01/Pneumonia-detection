# Pneumonia Detection Model

## Overview
This project is focused on developing a model to detect pneumonia from X-ray images. Using advanced transfer learning techniques, the model is trained to predict whether a person is suffering from pneumonia based on their chest X-ray.

## Features
- Predicts the presence of pneumonia from chest X-ray images.
- Utilizes transfer learning techniques for improved accuracy.
- User-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing X-ray images.

## Technologies and Libraries Used
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the neural network.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing.
- **Pillow**: For image manipulation.
- **Streamlit**: For building the web application interface.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/pneumonia_detection.git
    cd pneumonia_detection
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. To run the application locally, execute:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
